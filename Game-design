Fighter class:
Currently only two fighters exist in game, we need to develop a fighter class in order to make it more efficient to create new fighters for the game, as well as selecting them in game.

Hit detection/hitboxes
Hit boxes currently exist superficially, there are issues in getting collision detection of attacks. We need to update or create collision detection logic between attacks and other fighters.


Menu
	A simple menu for selecting fighters and maps is a goal for after fight mechanics are functional
	
	
	
	
Fighters

Currently only a generic boy and girl fighter in a variety of skin tones exist

Sandbag from smashbros exist in prototype for humor and for testing
